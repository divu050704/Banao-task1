# Problem Statement
1. Add 2 number input field in your previous extension named- like count and comment count.
2. Only after getting input in both field the button will be enabled.
3. On clicking the button in pop up it should go to Linkedin Feed (login to linkedin manually before this)
4. Randomly like(react) on posts with count from input. (If we enter 5 in “like count” field it will like(react) on only 5 posts)
5. Same for comments (you can use some generic comment for posting like “CFBR”)
